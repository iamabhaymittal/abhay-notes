## You rarely sell to a company

- There’s no such thing as “selling to a company”
- Not all people can make decisions
- Always sell to ********************************decision makers********************************  at a company
- Sales is about 1:1 conversations or meetings
- There are many different ways you can find decision makers. and sell your products.

## **Friction**

- Friction is the amount of resistance between a customer and his purchase
- The more time you as a sales rep have to spend with a customer, the more friction there is
- High friction sales take a lot of time and effort

## **Calculating friction**

- Friction score = (time spent by sales rep) * (total number of decision makers)
- Friction is a marker of how low your sales velocity is. It is the inverse of sales velocity

## **Sales velocity**

- A measure of how fast you can close a deal
- If you are an entrepreneur, raise as much capital to cover 2x your sales velocity
- Avoid high friction, low velocity sales (Ex: selling to the government)

## **Prospecting**

- We prospect by creating an **ideal buyer persona**
- This is a hypothetical person who would be the perfect customer for your product
- Before we start prospecting and initiating conversation, we generate leads in a process called **lead generation**

## **Steps to Lead generation**

## **Lead generation - 1**

- Use the following matrix to map your ideal buyer persona
- But always remember, at the end of the day, you sell to a person, not a company
- This list just narrows down the companies you want to sell to

## **Lead generation - 2**

- Once you have figured out the companies you want to sell to, let's move to the buyer

- Now we need to start reaching out to people who fit the buyer persona we have identified
- Sometimes, you might need to reach out to somebody one level lower (bottom up approach) or one level higher (top down approach) than the buyer persona you have identified
- Sometimes, you might be entirely wrong about this persona, in which case, you have to go back to the drawing board and start over
- All of these things take experimentation and time, which is why speeding up how fast you run these persona tests is important!

## **Outbound Leadgen using Sales Navigator**

- We're going to use LinkedIn Sales Navigator  along with the Foxbound Chrome extension to generate leads

## **People and companies have "buying windows"**

- A buying window is a time when a company is most likely to buy your product
- For example, if you are selling a product that helps companies with their taxes, the buying window is the end of the financial year
- If you are selling a product that helps companies with their hiring, the buying window is when they are hiring
  
## **Touches**

- In Enterprise sales, the 'double tap' -- the process of leaving a voicemail and sending an email -- is the most effective way to get a response
- Usually this is done everyday once a prospect enters a sales rep's pipeline, for 8 days
- Unless the prospect says a hard no, you then start reaching out to them once a month
- The 8 days tap is less about getting a response, and more about making the prospect aware of your product so they have **recall** when they have a need
- The **monthly taps** are all about actual selling

## **Immediate needs**
